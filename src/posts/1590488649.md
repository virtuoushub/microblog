I’m re-working a section of my talk “Keeping It Simple With CSS That
Scales” today. C-BEUT is gone and instead replaced with CUBE CSS -
Composition Utility Block Exception.

I see composition as a really important aspect of keeping things
simple. Micro-optimisation in my experience, has usually resulted in
fragile re-inventions of core language capabilities and we’re seeing
that again with various re-inventions of the Stack from Every Layout. 

I’ll blog about it on piccalilli later. 

C-BEUT was such a shit name.
