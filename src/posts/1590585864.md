I’ve written 0 lessons for the eleventy course today. I planned to
write at least two (even though I have 4 in my bullet journal lol).

Having 37 lessons to write is a real mountain, I must say. I’m into
double-digits now, but I refuse to force myself to write, if I’m
not feeling it. I don’t want the quality of the course to suffer. This
is one of my favourite parts about being my own boss: giving myself
maximum freedom!

I’m just gonna do some admin and play with the kids in the garden
instead and maybe I’ll write a lesson later.
