I feel incredibly demoralised today. 

I’ve been super careful about COVID since February and after seeing scenes in Soho, Bradford and elsewhere, yesterday: it’s only a matter of time before another lockdown comes around.

It’s my kids I feel really bad for. They haven’t seen family or friends for so long and have only just gone back to nursery. They don’t understand, but it’s clearly all taking a toll on them. 

This pandemic and lockdown has destroyed my mental health too--mainly because I’ve already got issues with health anxiety and obsessively hand wash at the best of times. 

I’ve no idea what state my mental health will be in at the end of the year. 

I'm really hoping for a miracle, but it wont come.
